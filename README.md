# rlhitboxes - Rocket League Hitboxes

This is a simple set of JSON, JavaScript, HTML and CSS to generate a table of Which Rocket League car has which hitbox.  

Data in the JSON file was adapted from [this Excel Online sheet](https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=F0182A0BAEBB5DFF!14583&ithint=file%2cxlsx&app=Excel&authkey=!ALu0cMkDZDoWOws) by [Rocket Science](https://youtube.com/rocketsciencerl).

Running the `hitboxes.js` will generate the table rows for the table started in `top.html`.
